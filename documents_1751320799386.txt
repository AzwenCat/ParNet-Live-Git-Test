Chances are if you're here, you're either me or one of ~10 other lovely people who get it, but this hub for content and information about the  Parenthia   universe is work-in-progress.  Parenthia  is an ode to and fan-reimagining of Homestuck, which we do not hold right to or claim to be involved with. Enjoy your stay <3 -L More will be available on this page as time progresses and the index of hosted information expands. At the moment the tabs up top will take you from this homepage to the  Wiki ,  Tales , or  About  section. I'm adding more information daily. Things will fill out soon. :3 Image Credit - 'Rose' @RoseRoxy_"

Someone left their lights on.\" - Vastro Vastro Quadex  is a  Parenthian  rustblood residing in the  Island Sector  prior to 0 AZ. He is a survivor of the undead outbreak and a Player in The Game.  Vastro's  primary venture is tinkering with machinery and robotics, most often scavenged from the Island's drones and other scrap. He is the maker of his own prosthetic arm,  Kisuna 's eyes, and the Train that saves the lives of the group destined for The Game, among other things. Description Vastro  is a rustblood, at the lowest rung of the hemospectrum, but at 6'1\" (185cm) he is the tallest troll in the main cast. His clothes are often stained in mechanical oil or coolant, and his hair is almost always obscuring his eyes. His right arm is entirely cybernetic up to the shoulder, replacing the organic one he lost during the trials, and has been fitted with a number of upgrades to assist Vastro in his work. It also houses his emergency strife weapon: a flamethrower.
