Vastro's  primary venture is tinkering with machinery and robotics, most often scavenged from the Island's drones and other scrap. He is the maker of his own prosthetic arm,  Kisuna 's eyes, and the Train that saves the lives of the group destined for The Game, among other things. Description Vastro  is a rustblood, at the lowest rung of the hemospectrum, but at 6'1\" (185cm) he is the tallest troll in the main cast. His clothes are often stained in mechanical oil or coolant, and his hair is almost always obscuring his eyes. His right arm is entirely cybernetic up to the shoulder, replacing the organic one he lost during the trials, and has been fitted with a number of upgrades to assist Vastro in his work. It also houses his emergency strife weapon: a flamethrower.

She is a survivor of the undead apocalypse, a God-tiered Player in The Game, and a member of the Train party. Preceding her escape on the Train in the chaos of the Outbreak, Cinnaa operated  Paws n' Claws Sanctuary  along with her lusus, a haven for lost or injured lusii. Despite being a far-off destination on the Island, it still served as the population's de facto veterinary clinic. Description Cinnaa  is a bronze-blooded troll standing at 5'4\" (162 cm) with long hair and right-angled, bull-like horns. She possesses notably higher than average physical strength and resilience despite her stature, a standout property of bronzes amongst other lowbloods. Her skin is dotted in freckles, and scars from physical work on the sanctuary. Her lusus, colloquially named  Mama Bear , is an unusually large white grizzlybeast who plays a dominant role in Cinnaa's life.

He is a God-tiered Player in The Game, and a member of the Train party. Making ends meet as a baker and sleeping at his workplace  Sweet Moon  cafe after the loss of his home,  Prokit' s real aspiration is to further himself as a mechanical gadgeteer and roboticist. A lasting, early testament to his potential is ' Deebee ', his robotic companion and first success at coding something of a 'consciousness'. Description Prokit  is a goldblood Parenthian standing at 5'2\" (157 cm). He is a troll with abnormally strong and unstable psionic energy, leading to a number of accidents when he's attempted to inject this energy into his various projects. His right side is covered in a major burn caused by an explosion, the same that removed his right set of horns. Insecurity about these wounds has lead him to wear more covering clothing like his gloves, cap, and even a bandage over his still-functional right eye.  Deebee , his psionic-powered robot assistant, is a six-legged insect bot the size of an average troll's fist. He is capable of floating and crawling, often begrudgingly helping Prokit manage his tasks both personal and at the bakery.

He is also secretly  \"The Boogie Troll\",  a vigilante killer who stalks and targets abusive highbloods while masquerading as a purpleblood. Description Kalrax  is a gold-blooded troll standing at 5'6\" (167 cm) with long, shaggy hair and twin sets of bent horns. He possesses naturally unstable psionics and struggles to control their output safely or practically, a main reason he was delegated to the Island from grubhood.

Keeping her hair in a long, large ponytail, the DJ's lifestyle sees her wearing a combination of comfortable street/techwear. She possesses higher than average mind reading and control strength in comparison to other ceruleans, however, experiencing manipulation earlier in life from the Empire and other highbloods has shaped her to morally oppose using her caste powers on others.
